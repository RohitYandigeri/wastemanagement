        <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Project 1</strong>: <strong>Braiding Machine(Engineering Exploration)</strong> a semi-automatic, compact, and lightweight braiding machine that is aesthetically pleasing, portable, and can braid thread/yarn. It should be developed within 90 days, using 4 thread rolls, and cost should be under Rs.5000. It should be able to braid and wind from the thread available from the storage. It should indicate the process and is controlled by using switches.</li>
            <li><strong>Project 2</strong>: <strong>LOW YIELD IN WHEAT CROP(DTSI)</strong> Our initiative aims to raise awareness among farmers in Unkal Village about the critical importance of prerequisite tests like soil testing and seed selection to enhance crop yield. By educating farmers on these practices, we empower them to optimize fertilizer use, correct soil deficiencies, and select high-quality, disease-resistant seeds. Through collaboration with experts and local communities, we promote informed decision-making and sustainable farming practices, aiming to increase wheat crop yields and ensure long-term agricultural prosperity in Unkal Village.</li>
            <li><strong>Project 3</strong>: <strong>Kaveri Vana (‡≤ï‡≤æ‡≤µ‡≥á‡≤∞‡≤ø ‡≤µ‡≤®)</strong> is a visionary smart city designed to harmonize modern technology with nature. Inspired by the serene flow of the Kaveri River, the city blends advanced infrastructure, sustainable energy solutions, and smart technology to create an eco-friendly, efficient, and vibrant community. Kaveri Vana aims to redefine urban living by focusing on green spaces, intelligent transportation, and seamless connectivity, fostering innovation and sustainability at its core.</li>
